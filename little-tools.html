	  <h2>Get RSS Feed from Youtube Channel</h2>
	  <p>
		This project was the inspiration for this page.
		However, the current implementation, which scrapes Youtube directly, is heidously inefficient.
		It takes ~10s to return 1 channel id; I might be able to optimize it a bit, but not enough to make it worth while.
		If I am going to do this, I'll need to use the Youtube API, which is just a bit more hassle.
		I'd use a simple middle server that reads from a cache if the channel name has already been tried, and if not pull fresh.
		Also enforce quota; easy enough with a simple request counter and then lock new requests until the next day.
