	  <h2>Experimental Constructed Languages</h2>
	  <p>
		A wide-area project that is centralized around the idea that the digital medium has properties that allow for truly foundational changes to human language.
		A non-exhaustive collection of some my research paths are included below.
	  </p>
	  <ul>
		<li>
		  A stenography theory based on semantic relationships, rather then phonetics
		  <div>The Hard problem is properly choosing and pruning the relationships used to efficiently compose strokes.</div>
		</li>
		<li>A geometric script
		  <div>I.E. All verbs are squares and all nouns are circles. Much more complex then that in practice, but that's the basic idea</div>
		</li>
		<li>
		  A system to compare and measure wildly different types of constructed languages
		  <div></div>

	  <h2>Mullvadi</h2>
	  <a href="https://github.com/h0ldnack/mullvadi">Github Link</a>
	  <p>
		A helper script for performing some high level functions with <a href=https://mullvad.net/en/">Mullvad</a>, my preferred vpn provider.
		I recently switched to <a href="https://voidlinux.org/">Void Linux</a>, because I am a hipser doofus, and it doesn't have the mullvad-vpn cli app packaged.
		I tried to package it, but I just switched to Void and don't know xbps at all.
		So I decided to write my own version.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		It also has some functionality that you can't get in the official mullvad app.
		It can choose the vpn endpoint that currently has the best perf.
		It can automitically rotate between wireguard configs.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		I also have some ideas for more functionality
		<ol>
		  <li>Periodically run a tcpdump trace and check for potential leaks</li>
		  <li>Test for increase of captcha's and rotate when they reach a certain level
			<div>I currently get captcha'd on every google query :(</div>
		  </li>
		</ol>
	  </p>
	  <p>
		There are some current downsides.
		<ol>
		  <li>
			Its a random app made by a competent, but by no means expert programmer.
		  </li>
		  <li>
			A lot of cmds require root, which the official app does not require.
			I think it communicates with a service that runs as root, so I might try somethign similar
		  </li>
		  <li>
			Its VERY new, so yeah all cmds "work", but expect bugs.
		  </li>
		</ol>
