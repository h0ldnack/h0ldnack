	  <h2>Experimental Constructed Languages</h2>
	  <p>
		A wide-area project that is centralized around the idea that the digital medium has properties that allow for truly foundational changes to human language.
		A non-exhaustive collection of some my research paths are included below.
	  </p>
	  <ul>
		<li>
		  A stenography theory based on semantic relationships, rather then phonetic
		  <div>The Hard problem is properly choosing and pruning the relationships used to efficiently compose strokes.</div>
		</li>
		<li>A geometrically defined script
		  <div>I.E. All verbs are squares and all nouns are circles. Much more complex then that in practice, but that's the basic idea</div>
		</li>
		<li>
		  A system to compare and measure wildly different types of constructed languages
		  <div></div>
