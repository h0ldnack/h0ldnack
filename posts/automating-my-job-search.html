	  <p>
		One of the main issues is getting new postings to add to the system.
		All job boards I am aware of have reasonably strong anti-scrapping measures; nothing that can't be worked around, but a pain nonetheless.
		However, almost all job boards allow email alerts with some or all matchs for a particular search.
		So, you can setup email alerts and scrap those emails instead of the website itself.
		I made a completely seperate gmail account solely for this purpose, and I'd recommend doing the same for security reasons.
