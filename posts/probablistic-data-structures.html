	<h1>Probablistic Data Structures</h1>
	<section>
	  <h2>Main Types</h2>
	  <h3>Bloom Filter | Tests if input is definetely not or maybe in a set</h3>
	  <h3>HyperLogLog | Counts instances of elements in a multiset</h3>
	  <h3>Skip List | Ordered sequence with efficient insertion</h3>
	  <h3>Treap | A binary tree where node priorities are randomized</h3>
	  <p>
		This structure avoids the simple explanations of its value, in contrast to the previous structures.
		Treaps have the advantage over traditional binary search trees of efficient inseration, deletion and search.
		Since treap's shape is a product of a random distribution no matter what change occurs, it always has approximately the same efficiency.
