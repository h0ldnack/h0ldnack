	  <h2>About</h2>
	  <section class="innerBox">
		<p>
		  I am currently looking for work, like all of us poor worker-bees.
		  I don't really have strong feelings on what I want to do.
		  So no, I won't care about being a WORKPLACE-HEROâ„¢ or any other cringey attempt at motivating me.
		  But if you are looking for someone who is self-motivated and quite competent, I am more then capable of doing that.

	  <h2>Experience</h2>
	  <section class="innerBox">
		<h3>Strang Hall | Restaurant</h3>
		<p>
		  I did standard host/busser/waiter work.
		  I took the job because I needed to be around people after lockdown.
		  I left because I was moving to Portland.
		</p>
		<h3>ScriptPro | IT Customer Support</h3>
		<p>
		  The company built pill dispensing machines, and I worked on customer support.
		  So I remotely troubleshoot windows, physical machine failures and other related issues.
		  I left because I needed to take some time to work through some mental health issues.
