		<h2>About</h2>
		<!-- <p>
		  I am currently looking for work.
		  I've been
		  I have recently started learning go, and I am so far enjoying the lazer focus on simplicity.
		</p>-->
		<p>
		  I am currently looking for work, like all of us poor worker-bees.
		  I don't really have strong feelings on what I want to do.
		  I've worked on tech as a hobby for about a decade, so I've accumulated a fair amount of experience in a wide range of technical areas.
		  So no, I won't care about being a WORKPLACE-HEROâ„¢ or any other "fun" corporate terminology.
		  I am a skilled and self-motivated worker, who can easily excel in a good working environment.

		<h2>Experience</h2>
		<h3>Benedictine College| BA in Economics | 2015-2019</h3>
		<p>
		  I had realized that I didn't want to work directly in Economics by my last semester.
		</p>
		<h3>Strang Hall | Restaurant | 2021-2022</h3>
		<p>
		  I did standard host/busser/waiter work.
		  I took the job because I needed to be around people after lockdown.
		  I left because I was moving to Portland.
		</p>
		<h3>ScriptPro | IT Customer Support | 2019-2020</h3>
		<p>
		  The company built pill dispensing machines, and I worked on customer support.
		  So I remotely troubleshoot windows, physical machine failures and other related issues.
		  I left because I needed to take some time to work through some mental health issues.
		</p>
		<h3>Personal Projects</h3>
		<p>
		  I've worked on a variety of projects over the years, ranging from static-site-generators to viable-systems model network simulators to highly experimental stenography theories.
		  Unfortunately, I have also had the bad habit of hopping to a new shiny project before finishing old projects.
		  So, I am currently in the process of reviewing and finishing up some of my old projects.
		  Once I have finished a few, I will include a link to my portfolio in the links section.
